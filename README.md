# UNAS-Interpreter
CSCI 415 Final project, the Unnamed Assembly (UNAS) language interpreter. 

While at Lake Superior State University in the Computer Science program I was put through the Computer Organization and Architecture class. The primary function of this class was to give us a firm understanding of computers as a logical concept, and then to get our hands dirty with assembly. My professor has developed his own reduced instruction set computer (RISC) language, simply called “Unnamed Assembly Language” or “UNAS” for short. The language runs on a virtual processor, and is a fantastic transitionary language when stepping down to assembly from C++.

The class was riddled with programming assignments that were either solely mathematical in nature, or stress tested our understanding of stacks and main memory. I loved programming in UNAS, and when it was time to declare a final project I knew I wanted to take my learning to the next level. We got to pick from a list of projects, and the most challenging was to write an “UNAS Interpreter.” Now we never actually covered compilers, or interpreters in this class so, it was a challenge.
